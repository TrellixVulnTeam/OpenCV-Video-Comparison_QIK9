# OpenCV Video Comparison
<p align="justify">In order to compare multiple video, scene etc... Compute similarity, and say if video are of the same origin even if modified, altered, scene cutted or added and even content modification. To detect the similarity between video, we are going to use the following detection principles :</p>

- Perceptual evaluation of video and image quality (blurry, overexposure, color distortion)
- Object detection (image) SIFT
- Face and person detection
- Primary color(R, G, B) histogram to detect scene transition
